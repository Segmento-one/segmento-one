👽 ### **The Recruiter Who Started Building the Tools**

### About Me

🚶‍♂️ 🇿🇦 → 🇬🇧 Migration: Complete  
🧱 Building **recruitment systems**, not “spray-and-pray pipelines”  
🎨 UX + clarity > noise + chaos  
🧠 Recruiter who became a Product Person™  
☎️ Still on calls — because real insight doesn’t come from dashboards  

### What I'm Doing

⚙️ Helping SaaS teams hire better, faster, cleaner  
🔧 Designing workflows with **Mocha + Cloudflare Workers + LLMs**  
🤖 Trying to replace bad recruiters, not good ones  
🔍 Teaching AI to evaluate candidates better than “quick scan of the CV”  
🤝 Recruiting only for teams who *actually* care about quality  
✂️ Removing friction from hiring, one workflow at a time  

### Current Projects

- **Vettor** — AI-powered candidate evaluation & workflow automation *(shipping / in use)*  
- **Appidavit** — AI-driven case intake & structured summaries *(live prototype phase)*  
- **Segmento** — Tokenised funding infrastructure *(concept → regulatory shaping)*
